# Emotion Detection using Machine learning

## Overview
- This project focuses on developing an emotion detection model capable of recognizing seven distinct emotions: 
*anger, happy, sad, surprise, disgust, shock, and normal*. 
- The process involves dataset preprocessing, model initialization using TensorFlow and Keras, and subsequent training.
- The project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of emotions through a machine learning model, with the training progress visualized using loss graphs.

## Dataset Preprocessing
- The initial step involves preprocessing datasets specific to each emotion. 
- This includes cleaning, normalization, and feature extraction to ensure a consistent and meaningful representation of emotional cues in the data.

## Model Initialization and Training
- The TensorFlow and Keras frameworks are employed to construct a neural network tailored for emotion detection. 
- The model architecture is designed to accommodate the nuances of different emotions. 
- Training involves feeding the preprocessed datasets into the model and iteratively optimizing its parameters to achieve accurate emotion classification.

## Training Progress Visualization
- Training and validation loss graphs are generated to visually assess the model's performance. 
- These graphs offer insights into the convergence and generalization of the model, aiding in fine-tuning and optimization.
